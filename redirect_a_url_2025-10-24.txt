Redirecting a URL involves sending users and search engines from one web address to another. Here are three common methods to achieve this:

1. Server-Side Redirect (Recommended for SEO)
This is the most reliable and SEO-friendly method. Use a 301 redirect for permanent changes or a 302 redirect for temporary ones.
Example (Using .htaccess for Apache Servers):
Apache# Permanent Redirect (301)
Redirect 301 /old-page https://www.example.com/new-page

# Temporary Redirect (302)
Redirect 302 /old-page https://www.example.com/new-page


2. Client-Side Redirect (HTML or JavaScript)
This method is less ideal for SEO but works when server access is unavailable.
Example (HTML Meta Refresh):
Html<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://www.example.com/new-page">

Example (JavaScript Redirect):
Javascriptwindow.location.href = "https://www.example.com/new-page";


3. PHP Redirect
If your website uses PHP, you can redirect using the following code:
Php<?php
header("Location: https://www.example.com/new-page", true, 301);
exit();
?>


Each method has its use case, but server-side redirects are generally preferred for maintaining SEO rankings and ensuring a smooth user experience.
